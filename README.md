# Project Description


**Code in HTML**: In this project, I wrote HTML code to create a web page that includes various tags such as <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, and others. I also included images and links to other web pages.

**Pushed to GitHub**: After writing the HTML code, I created a GitHub account and set up a new repository to store the code. I then used Git to push the code to the repository, allowing me to keep track of changes and collaborate with others.

**Created AWS server**: To deploy the HTML code, I created an AWS server using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). I chose an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux as the operating system and configured the instance to use HTTPD, which is a popular web server.

**Started server services**: After creating the AWS server, I started the services of the created server. This included starting the HTTPD web server and ensuring that it was configured correctly.

**Installed Git on AWS server**: In order to deploy the code to the AWS server, I needed to install Git on the server. I used the Yum package manager to install Git on the Amazon Linux instance.

**Cloned GitHub repository**: Once Git was installed on the AWS server, I used the git clone command to clone the GitHub repository onto the server. This allowed me to pull the HTML code from the repository onto the server and work on it locally.

**Pushed to server**: Finally, I pushed the HTML code to the server by using the git push command. This deployed the HTML code to the live environment and made it accessible to users via the server's IP address.
